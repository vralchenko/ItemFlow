# Item Flow

**Item Flow** is a full-stack web application demonstrating a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implementation. The application consists of a Node.js/Express backend and a React frontend.

This project serves as a comprehensive example covering API development, state management, form validation, filtering, pagination, file uploads, automated testing, and internationalization.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Item CRUD:** Full create, read, update, and delete operations for items.
* **Category CRUD:** Separate management for categories, including creation, editing, and deletion.
* **Relational Data:** Items are linked to categories via a dropdown selection.
* **Filtering:** Real-time search for items by name.
* **Pagination:** Division of long lists into multiple pages.
* **Image Uploads:** Ability to attach images to items.
* **Form Validation:** Checks for empty fields and duplicate entries.
* **User Notifications (Toasts):** Pop-up messages indicating the success or failure of an operation.
* **Localization (i18n):** Multi-language support (EN, DE, RU, UK) with language detection.
* **Polished UI:** The interface is built with the Material-UI component library.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** Includes backend API tests and full end-to-end (E2E) tests.

## üåç Localization

The application supports multiple languages and will automatically detect the user's browser language on the first visit. Users can also manually switch between supported languages.

* **Supported Languages:** English (en), German (de), Russian (ru), Ukrainian (uk).
* **Implementation:** Achieved using the `react-i18next` library.
* **Translation Files:** All text strings are stored in JSON format located in the `frontend/src/locales/` directory, separated by language code.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project is structured as a monorepo with two primary directories:

* `backend/`: Contains the Node.js server application.
* `frontend/`: Contains the React client application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (v18.x or higher)
* **npm** (typically installed with Node.js)

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend folder**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install all dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create the environment file**

    In the `backend` folder, create a file named `.env.development` and add the following content:
    ```env
    PORT=3001
    API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
    DATABASE_PATH=./database.sqlite
    ```

4.  **Create and seed the development database**

    This command creates the `database.sqlite` file and populates it with initial data.
    ```bash
    npm run db:init
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend folder** (in a separate terminal window)
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install all dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create the environment file**

    In the `frontend` folder, create a file named `.env` and add the following content:
    ```env
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
    ```

## üöÄ Running the Application

You need to run two servers simultaneously in two separate terminals.

### Running the Backend

# In your /backend terminal
```bash
    npm start
```

The server will be available at http://localhost:3001.

Running the Frontend
Bash

# In your /frontend terminal
```bash
    npm run dev
```

The application will open in your browser at http://localhost:5173.

üß™ Testing
The project is covered by two types of tests using Playwright. A separate, isolated database is used for all test runs.

1. Preparing the Test Environment
Before running tests for the first time, you must create the test database.

Bash

# In the /backend terminal
```bash
    npm run test:init-db
```

This command will create and seed the test-database.sqlite file.

2. Running API Tests (Backend)
These tests check the API endpoints directly without a UI.

Start the backend in test mode (in your first terminal):

Bash

# In the /backend folder
```bash
  npm run start:test
```

Run the tests (in a second terminal):

Bash

# In the /backend folder
```bash
  npm run test:api
```

3. Running End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Frontend)
These tests simulate real user interactions in a browser.

Start the backend in test mode (in your first terminal):

Bash

# In the /backend folder
```bash
  npm run start:test
```

Run the tests (in a second terminal):

Bash

# In the /frontend folder
```bash
  npx playwright test
```

4. Viewing Reports
After running either Playwright test suite, you can view a detailed HTML report:

For API tests:

Bash

# In the /backend folder
```bash
  npx playwright show-report
```

For E2E tests:

Bash

# In the /frontend folder
```bash
    npx playwright show-report
```

The report will open in your browser, showing all test steps, screenshots, and network trace information.
